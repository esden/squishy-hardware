# Board-to-Board

This document details the interface between the main module and the PHY module, and the PHY module and the connector module.

## Common

There are a few common features between the board-to-board connections, mainly the connectors being used.

 * Connector: [LSHM-150-06.0-L-DV-A-S-K-TR] from [samtec]

Due to the connector being self-mating, the connector on the main board is rotated 180Â° from the connector on the PHY module, which means that the pins from row 1 are connected to row 2 and vis-versa, as the connector uses an even-odd pin mapping, this means that pin 1 is connected to pin 2, 3 to 4, etc.
