## Development and Testing

Prior working on squishy, ensure you understand have have followed the general [Installation](https://docs.scsi.moe/install.html) guide, when installing Squishy make sure to add `[dev]` do the package name to ensure the needed development tools are installed along with squishy.

Alternatively, use `pip` to install [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/), like so:

```
$ pip install nox
```

General testing and linting of Squishy is done with nox, as such there are some session names to know about:

 * `test` - Run the test suite
 * `lint` - Run the linter
 * `typecheck` - Run the type-checker

Bye default these are configured to run one right after another when invoking `nox` with no arguments, to run a single check, you can run it with passing `-s <session>` to nox, like so:

```
$ nox -s lint
```

In addition to this, to work on the hardware, you need a copy of [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) 7.0 or newer.
