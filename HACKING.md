# Information and Terminology Guide

This file is a resource in order to hopefully get someone who is unfamiliar with the codebase
or terminology up to speed enough to quickly be able to successfully understand and make changes
within the codebase.

The information here is likely incomplete, but there will be ongoing effort in order ensure it is
as up-to-date as possible.

## Repository Structure

This repository is broken up into several sections. The root of this repository contains files that are globally applicable, such as the licenses, readme, and various editor and linting configurations.

Within the root of this repository there are four sub directories:
 * [.github](./.github/) - Various metadata for github, such as workflow and issue templates.
 * [boards](./boards/) - The active work in progress boards.
 * [contrib](./contrib/) - Various documents such as hardware checklists and plans.
 * [release](./release/) - Released versions of the hardware and their design files.


Each directory has it's own layout in an attempt to be as logical as possible.
