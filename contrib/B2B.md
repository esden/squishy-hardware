# Board-to-Board

This document details the interface between the main module and the PHY module, and the PHY module and the connector module.

## Connector choice

The mezzanine connectors used between the Squishy mainboard, PHY, and connector interface are from [Amphenol FCI].

* [10144518-101802LF] From mainboard to PHY and PHY to connector interface
* [10144517-102802LF] Mating connector for [10144518-101802LF]


> [!NOTE]
> To ensure proper keying, the [10144517-102802LF] mezzanine on the connector boards is
> rotated 180Â° to prevent you from plugging them into the mainboard in a sensable way, thus
> damaging the device.
